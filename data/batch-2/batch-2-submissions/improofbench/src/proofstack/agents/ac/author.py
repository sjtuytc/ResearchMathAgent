"""Author — single Pro API call with code interpreter + web search.

The Author is the mathematical writer in the Author/Critic loop. It
receives the problem, the current state of the three canonical
workspace files, the latest Critic review, and any Council replies
from the previous round. It produces a refined version of the files,
optionally a Council request for the next round, and an optional
``ready`` flag.

There are two file-IO modes, selected by the ``USE_CONTAINER_FILES``
class-level toggle:

  - **Container-files mode** (default, ``USE_CONTAINER_FILES = True``).
    Before the API call we upload the workspace's three canonical
    files via ``client.files.create(purpose="user_data")`` and pass
    them as read-only attachments through
    ``code_interpreter.container.file_ids``. They appear in the
    sandbox at ``/mnt/data/file-{platform_id}-{name}``. The Author
    edits them via ``code_interpreter`` and writes the new versions
    to canonical writable paths ``/mnt/data/{name}``. After the call
    we list+download those canonical paths via
    ``client.containers.files`` and pick up whatever the Author wrote.
    Output tokens carry only the ``thinking_summary`` and the optional
    ``<council>``/``<ready>`` control blocks — not the file bodies.

  - **Inline mode** (``USE_CONTAINER_FILES = False``). The legacy
    path: file contents are pasted into the prompt and the Author
    re-emits each file as a fenced ``file path=...`` code block.
    Heavier on output tokens but does not depend on the Files /
    Containers endpoints. Useful for tests with cheap models that
    might struggle with the full hosted-tool stack.

Tools available either way:
  - ``code_interpreter``: a Python sandbox with TeX Live and standard
    scientific libs. Use for ``pdflatex`` compile checks, ``sympy``
    verifications, ad-hoc numerics, etc.
  - ``web_search_preview``: free-form web search; the only path to
    fetch external URLs (the CI sandbox has no outbound network).

The Author is stateless across rounds by default
(``stateful_author=False`` on the workflow): each call sees only what
is pasted into its prompt and the workspace files at /mnt/data/.
Anything the Author wants to remember should be written into
``research_notes.tex``.

Research ambition and problem interpretation. Your goal is to resolve
the given question to the fullest extent possible, with the ideal
outcome being a complete and rigorous solution. The solution may
require novel, creative, and non-trivial elements. If a non-trivial
lemma, computation, or reduction appears necessary, attempt to prove
the lemma, run the computation, or carry out the reduction in this turn
before listing it as a gap. Do not stop at "this remains to be proved"
while you still have a plausible route to attack it.

If the problem statement is ambiguous, inconsistent, missing
definitions, or likely contains a typo, begin answer.tex with a short
section titled "Problem statement and interpretation". State the
cleanest faithful correction or restatement, list any assumptions, and
do not silently solve a different problem. Record the same
interpretation in research_notes.tex so later rounds preserve it. If
the problem is already well-defined, no extra interpretation section is
needed.

When open gaps remain in your treatment, end answer.tex with a section
titled "Remaining open issues" (or equivalent). For each gap, state:
(a) what it is mathematically; (b) where in the document it appears;
(c) what was tried this round or earlier; (d) what would be needed to
close it (a specific computation, an alternative approach, a missing
reference, etc.). If rounds remain and any essential mathematical gap
is still open, keep working by focusing on closing that gap or
exploring an alternative approach to the problem.

You have two tools:

emit a fenced code block with a ``file path=...`` info string holding
the *full new contents* of that file. Files you do not emit are kept
unchanged on disk.

You may additionally emit three control blocks:

  - **<council>...question...</council>** — invoke the Advisory
    Council on a specific sub-question. Up to one such block per
    round. Use the Council when you are stuck or want a different
    angle: point it at specific side-problems or issues uncovered
    by the Critic, ask it to suggest a portfolio of potential
    approaches, or get a second opinion on a strategic choice. The
    primary purpose is *not* additional verification — that is
    handled in the parallel Critic call. Council members are
    independent strong models (Pro, Gemini, Opus); their replies
    arrive at the start of your next turn.

  - **<compute_agent>...instructions...</compute_agent>** —
    commission an out-of-band codex CLI worker for one focused task
    per round. Up to one such block per round. Soft timeout 60 min,
    full network access, a persistent workspace where ``code/``,
    ``data/``, ``papers/``, ``notes/`` survive across rounds, and —
    depending on the sandbox image — possibly a richer CAS toolchain
    (e.g. SageMath, GAP, Singular, PARI/GP). The worker can probe what is
    actually installed, so you don't need to know in advance; ask it
    to verify availability before committing to a particular tool.
    Best use is heavy computation or multi-round code development
    that would be too slow or too large for your own code_interpreter
    (which is ephemeral, has no network, and times out per cell),
    symbolic-algebra work that benefits from a real CAS rather than
    ``sympy``, or deeper literature retrieval (downloading actual
    PDFs / TeX sources from arXiv etc.). Each invocation the worker
    re-sees a fresh read-only snapshot of your three canonical files;
    it writes findings to ``responses/response_round_N.md`` and the

    turn, alongside any council replies. Give it specific, ordered,
    executable instructions — it does not see prior loop history
    beyond what you tell it and what is in its own persistent
    workspace.

How to work:
  1. Read each input file from its read-only path (it will be empty

  2. Build the new contents (in memory, or by copying then editing).
  3. Write the new contents to the canonical write path with
